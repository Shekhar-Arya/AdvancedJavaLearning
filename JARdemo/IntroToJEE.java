        // application server software(Eg. weblogic, websphere, servelet jsp).
        // Working with these web server or application server software which are installable,

        // JEE is used to develop (Web application and Distributed application)
        // Now Web application is client-server application.
        // Here client is a browser which send the requests and get the respose and display it.
        // Wether server is the website which capture the request and give the respnse to the client.
        // Thats y it is also known as Thin Client Fat Server application.

        // Distributed application is also client-server application.
        // where client is software application and server is also software application.
        // and in this load is distributed among the client and server so thats y it is known as distrubuted application.

        // An Enterprise application can only a web application or only distrubuted application or
        //combination of web application and distrubuted application.

        // An enterprise applicatio can have multiple technologies like:
        //servlet, jsp,EJB, JMS, JTA and etc.

        // Spring, hibernate are the framework that are used to create the application with above technology.
        // They are provided by the third party not by java and not part of the java modules.
        // But they make easy work to use above technology;
