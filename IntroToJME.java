        // Micro application can also be attached with mechanical, electrical, etc devices,
        // So that they can perform certain tasks thats y they are known as micro application. Eg Fully automatic Washing machine.

        // JME supports embedded system programming and Artificial Intelligence.
        // two types of programming
        //1. Genral system programming  2. Embedded system programming
        //Genral system programming means we wrote a java program and it is using 5% resources of computer system,
        // when it is install in other computer it will required full 100% of computer to run the program,
        // but it will use only 5% of the resources of that computer too.

        // Embedded system programming means we wrote a program on computer than that program can be put into,
        // electronic chip that chip can be placed in different places like mechanical, electrical elements.
        // And it will not required the 100% of the computer to run the program.
