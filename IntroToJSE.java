        // JSE is nothing but installable software as JDK.
        // This is usefull for Standalone apps and applets
        // Now if we talk about Standalone apps then this are application that will run only for wherever it is installed.
        // Eg. like antivirus or single player game.
        // There are two types of Standalone apps.
        // A) CUI (Character User Interface) app /Console app,  java class is example
        // B) GUI (Graphic User Interface) app /Desktop app, any app with buttons and lables and all are example.
        // Now if we talk about applets than this are java based web pages.
        // Like java classes that can be sent over to the network.
        // HTML and applets are different. There is less security in HTML but easy to use.
        // And There is more security in applets but not easy to use as HTML.
        // There are two type of applets.
        // 1) trusted applet -This applet when downloaded from network,
        // It cannot read from our system or it cannot write any thing to our system.
        // So There is no way that virus can be read to that applet or can be read from that applet.
        // 2) untrusted applet - This is reverse of the trusted applet.

        // Alterantive for JSE Modules are:- VB, VB.net, D2K, Fox Pro and etc.

        // Core Java is Basically the initiall part of the JSE module language part.
        // And Advance Java is the technology part of the JSE module and initial technology of JEE.
        // Technology like JDBC, servelet, nd etc.
